Step 1: Calculate the Average Time
Average time taken: 3 minutes 12 seconds


Step 2: Arrange Times in Order
Times arranged in order from shortest to longest.


Step 3: Find the Median Time
Median time taken: 2 minutes 15 seconds


Step 4: Compare Average and Median
Average (3:12) > Median (2:15)


Step 5: Interpret Results
The data is slightly skewed, with some users taking longer than average to complete the task.


Result:
The average time taken is 3 minutes 12 seconds, and the median time taken is 2 minutes 15 seconds. The data is slightlyÂ skewed.
